# Install Python dependencies
# First, copy only the requirements file to leverage Docker cache
COPY requirements.txt /tmp/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /tmp/requirements.txt

# If the calendar service has its own requirements, create and use that:
# COPY services/calendar-service/requirements.txt /tmp/calendar-requirements.txt
# RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /tmp/calendar-requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code for the calendar service
# Assuming the calendar service code is in services/calendar-service/
COPY services/calendar-service/ /app/calendar-service/

# Expose the port the app runs on (e.g., 8000 for FastAPI)
EXPOSE 8000

# Define the command to run the application
# This assumes your FastAPI app is in main.py and the app object is named "app"
# CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
# For now, a placeholder command as main.py doesn't exist yet
CMD ["python", "-c", "print('Calendar service placeholder. main.py with FastAPI app (uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000) needed.')"]
