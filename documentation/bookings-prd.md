# Calendar Slot Reservation Tool - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a self-serve calendar slot reservation tool that enables users to share booking links for scheduling meetings. The tool supports two primary use cases: evergreen booking links for ongoing availability sharing, and one-time recipient-specific links for targeted meeting scheduling.

## Core Features

### 1. Evergreen Booking Links
**Purpose**: Persistent, shareable links for ongoing availability (social media profiles, email signatures, etc.)

#### Requirements:
- Generate permanent URLs that remain active until manually disabled
- Support multiple concurrent evergreen links per user with different configurations
- Real-time calendar conflict checking against user's Microsoft/Google calendars
- Automatic time zone detection and conversion for recipients
- Customizable booking windows (e.g., 1-30 days in advance, specific date ranges)
- Buffer time configuration (before/after meetings)
- Meeting duration options (15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr, custom)
- Daily/weekly availability limits
- Link analytics (views, bookings, conversion rates)

#### User Flow:
1. User creates evergreen link with availability preferences
2. System generates shareable URL
3. Recipients visit link and see available time slots
4. Recipients select slot and provide required information
5. Meeting is automatically scheduled in both calendars
6. Confirmation emails sent to both parties

### 2. One-Time Recipient Links
**Purpose**: Single-use, personalized links for specific meeting requests (interviews, business meetings, etc.)

- Leverage existing meeting polls calendar tool for time slot selection
- Generate unique URLs tied to specific recipients
- Link expires after successful booking or configurable timeout
- Pre-populate recipient information when possible
- Integration with existing contacts database

#### User Flow:
1. User selects recipient from contacts or enters new contact
2. User picks available time slots using existing meeting polls interface
3. System generates recipient-specific link with proposed times
4. Recipient receives link via email/SMS
5. Recipient selects preferred time slot
6. Meeting is scheduled and confirmations sent
7. Link becomes inactive
