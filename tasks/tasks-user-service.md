## Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

### Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** 
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  

### Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the “Relevant Files” section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

### AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep “Relevant Files” accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update this file.
