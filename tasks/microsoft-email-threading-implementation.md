# Microsoft Email Threading Implementation

## Problem Statement

The current email threading implementation relies on Microsoft Graph API's `conversationId` field, which doesn't work reliably for grouping emails into threads. Users see individual emails instead of properly grouped threads (e.g., seeing 1 email instead of 3 in a thread that should contain multiple emails).

## Root Cause Analysis

- **Microsoft Graph API's `conversationId`** is more like a "conversation topic" rather than a strict thread grouping
- **Emails in the same thread** can have different `conversationId` values
- **Microsoft's threading logic** differs significantly from Gmail's `threadId` approach
- **Frontend smart threading** attempts (subject-based grouping) are unreliable

## Solution: Microsoft Graph Threading API

Microsoft Graph provides dedicated threading APIs that properly group emails into conversations/threads. We need to implement these APIs to get accurate thread information.

## Design Overview

### Architecture Changes

1. **Backend: New Microsoft Graph Threading Endpoints**
   - Add Microsoft Graph conversation/thread API calls
   - Create new unified threading endpoints
   - Modify email fetching to include thread information

2. **Frontend: Thread-Aware Email Display**
   - Fetch thread information when needed
   - Merge thread data with email data
   - Implement thread-based email grouping

### API Design

#### New Backend Endpoints

```
GET /api/v1/email/threads
- Get all threads for a user
- Parameters: providers, limit, offset, folder_id, labels

GET /api/v1/email/threads/{thread_id}
- Get specific thread with all emails
- Parameters: include_body, no_cache

GET /api/v1/email/messages/{message_id}/thread
- Get thread for a specific message
- Parameters: include_body, no_cache
```

#### Microsoft Graph API Integration

```
GET /me/mailFolders/{folder-id}/messages?$expand=conversation
GET /me/messages?$expand=conversation
GET /me/conversations/{conversation-id}/messages
```
