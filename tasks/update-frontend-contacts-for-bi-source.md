# Update Frontend Contacts Tool for Bi-Contact Source Concept

## Overview
The Contacts Service now provides a unified view of contacts from two sources:
1. **Office Contacts** - Synced from Google/Microsoft (via Office Service read-through)
2. **Discovered Contacts** - Automatically discovered from email, calendar, and document events

The frontend needs to be updated to represent and manage this bi-source concept with proper CRUD operations.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### âœ… What's Already Working
- [x] Gateway routes `/api/v1/contacts/*` to Contacts Service (port 8007)
- [x] Contacts Service has read-through to Office Service for office integration data
- [x] Contact models support `source_services` field to track origin
- [x] Office integration service enriches contacts with provider data
- [x] Frontend has basic contact display components
- [x] TypeScript types exist for both old Office contacts and new Contacts Service

### ðŸ”„ Current Data Flow
1. Frontend calls `/api/v1/contacts` (now routed to Contacts Service)
2. Contacts Service fetches discovered contacts from database
3. Contacts Service calls Office Service to get office integration data
4. Contacts Service merges data and returns unified response
5. Frontend displays contacts with source indicators

## Implementation Notes

### Complete Frontend Rewrite Strategy
Instead of data transformation, we're completely rewriting the frontend to use the new data structure directly. This approach:

1. **Eliminates Technical Debt** - No more legacy contact type handling
2. **Improves Performance** - Direct use of new API responses
3. **Better User Experience** - Native support for new features
4. **Easier Maintenance** - Single source of truth for contact data
5. **Future-Proof** - Easy to add new contact sources and features

### New Data Structure Usage
The frontend will directly use the Contacts Service data structure:

```typescript
// Direct usage of new contact structure
interface Contact {
  id?: string;
  user_id: string;
  email_address: string;
  display_name?: string;
  given_name?: string;
  family_name?: string;
  source_services: string[];
  event_counts: Record<string, EmailContactEventCount>;
  total_event_count: number;
  relevance_score: number;
  last_seen: string;
  first_seen: string;
  tags: string[];
  notes?: string;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}
```

### Source Service Mapping
The frontend will directly use the `source_services` array from the API:

- `['office']` - Pure office contact (Google/Microsoft)
- `['email']` - Discovered from email events  
- `['calendar']` - Discovered from calendar events
- `['documents']` - Discovered from document events
- `['office', 'email']` - Office contact also found in email events
- `['email', 'calendar']` - Contact found in multiple event types

### Component File Structure
The new contact system will be organized as:

```
frontend/components/contacts/
â”œâ”€â”€ contact-card.tsx          # Individual contact display
â”œâ”€â”€ contact-filters.tsx       # Filtering and search controls
â”œâ”€â”€ contact-actions.tsx       # Bulk actions and buttons
â”œâ”€â”€ contact-form.tsx          # Create new contact form
â”œâ”€â”€ edit-contact-form.tsx     # Edit existing contact form
â”œâ”€â”€ contact-detail-modal.tsx  # Full contact details
â”œâ”€â”€ discovery-settings.tsx    # Discovery management
â”œâ”€â”€ contact-merger.tsx        # Duplicate merging interface
â””â”€â”€ analytics-dashboard.tsx   # Contact analytics
```

### Relevance Scoring
The frontend should leverage the relevance scoring system:
- Sort contacts by relevance score by default
- Show relevance factors (recency, frequency, diversity, name completeness)
- Allow users to adjust relevance weights
- Provide relevance-based recommendations
