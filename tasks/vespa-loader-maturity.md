# Vespa Loader Service Maturity Checklist

This document tracks the areas for improvement needed to bring the vespa_loader service up to the standards outlined in the new service guide.

## Overview

The vespa_loader service is a stateless document processing service that ingests documents and indexes them into Vespa. It's well-architected for its purpose but needs improvements in project consistency and integration standards.

**Current Score: 8/10**

## Areas for Improvement

### Dependency Management (Medium Priority)
- [x] Convert `services/vespa_loader/pyproject.toml` from setuptools to UV/poetry format
- [x] Update dependency management to match other services
- [x] Ensure all dependencies use consistent versioning

### Service Registration Completeness (Medium Priority)
- [x] Add entry to `scripts/check-db-status.sh` indicating "no database required"
- [x] Add entry to `scripts/run-migrations.sh` indicating "no migrations required"
- [x] Verify service is properly configured in `scripts/start-all-services.sh` (already done)

### API Key Authentication (Medium Priority)
- [x] Add API key configuration to `services/vespa_loader/settings.py`
- [x] Implement API key verification in `services/vespa_loader/main.py` for protected endpoints
- [x] Add API key environment variables to `.example.env`
- [x] Update ingest endpoints in `services/vespa_loader/main.py` to require API key authentication

### Configuration Management (Minor)
- [x] Add missing environment variables for inter-service communication to `.example.env`
- [x] Ensure all configuration in `services/vespa_loader/settings.py` follows centralized settings pattern
- [x] Add service URL configuration to `services/vespa_loader/settings.py` for inter-service calls

### Health Check Enhancement (Minor)
- [x] Enhance `/health` endpoint in `services/vespa_loader/main.py` to check Vespa connectivity
- [x] Add Pub/Sub consumer status to health checks in `services/vespa_loader/main.py`
- [x] Implement comprehensive health status reporting in `services/vespa_loader/main.py`
- [x] Add external service dependency verification in `services/vespa_loader/main.py`

### Error Handling Consistency (Minor)
- [x] Ensure all endpoints in `services/vespa_loader/main.py` use standard error classes consistently
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints in `services/vespa_loader/main.py`
- [x] Add proper error logging and monitoring in `services/vespa_loader/main.py`

### Environment Configuration (Minor)
- [ ] Add API key environment variables to `.example.env`
- [ ] Add service URL configuration to `.example.env`
- [ ] Document all required environment variables in `.example.env`

## Implementation Notes

### Why No Database Integration?
The vespa_loader service is correctly designed as a stateless service because:
- It processes documents and immediately sends them to Vespa
- It doesn't maintain state between requests
- It's designed to be horizontally scalable
- The service correctly focuses on its core responsibility: document ingestion and indexing

### Priority Levels
- **Medium Priority**: Dependency management, API key authentication, service registration
- **Minor Priority**: Health checks, error handling, environment configuration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Service follows project dependency management standards
- [ ] All inter-service communication is properly authenticated
- [ ] Service is fully integrated into startup and monitoring scripts
- [ ] Health checks provide comprehensive service status
- [ ] Configuration follows centralized settings pattern
- [ ] Service maintains its stateless architecture while improving integration
