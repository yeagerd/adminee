# Email Integration System - Task List with Embedded TDD

## System Overview
A multi-provider email integration system that processes Gmail and Microsoft email notifications to extract
package tracking numbers, survey response URLs, and Amazon package status updates through a unified pubsub a
rchitecture. The system is designed for extensibility, reliability, and secure handling of user data, with c
lear service boundaries and robust error handling.


## Architecture Overview
- **Notification Receivers:**
  - **Gmail:** HTTP endpoint (containerized service) receives push notifications.
  - **Microsoft:** Serverless function (e.g., Cloud Function/Lambda) receives webhook calls and publishes to
 the `microsoft-notifications` pubsub topic.

- **Sync Services:**
  - **Unified Email Sync Service:** Handles both Gmail and Microsoft notifications, with modular adapters fo
r each provider. (Alternative: Split services if scaling or provider-specific logic requires.)

- **Email Parser Service:**
  - Subscribes to the `email-processing` topic, parses emails for tracking numbers, survey URLs, and Amazon
package status updates.

- **Downstream Services:**
  - **Package Tracker Service** and **Meeting Poll Service** consume parsed events.
- **PubSub Topics:**
  - All inter-service communication uses well-defined pubsub topics with strict schema validation and access
 controls.
