## üßπ Vespa Loader Refactor and Dead Code Cleanup

- [x] Fix PubSubConsumer bug: set `self.embedding_generator = embedding_generator` (not `document_mapper`).
- [ ] Move `VespaDocumentFactory` out of `services/vespa_loader/pubsub_consumer.py` into a dedicated module (e.g., `services/vespa_loader/document_factory.py`) or `mapper.py`.
- [ ] Move `_parse_event_by_topic()` from `pubsub_consumer.py` into the new `document_factory.py` (or the chosen module) as a top-level function.
- [ ] Update `pubsub_consumer.py` to import and use `VespaDocumentFactory` and `parse_event_by_topic()` from the new module; remove in-file definitions.
- [ ] Align `DocumentMapper` with `VespaDocumentType` field names by supporting aliases: map `from_address`‚Üí`from`, `to_addresses`‚Üí`to` when missing.
- [ ] Remove unused `EmailContentProcessor` wiring from `pubsub_consumer.py`; decide to deprecate or delete `services/vespa_loader/email_processor.py` and its tests if truly unused.
- [ ] Decide fate of `services/vespa_loader/models.py` (Pydantic router models). If unused, deprecate or delete and adjust any references.
- [ ] Ensure `ingest_document_service()` path remains stable after refactor; keep `DocumentMapper` in the event path for now.
- [ ] Add/adjust tests to cover: event parsing by topic, factory output, mapper alias handling, and end-to-end ingest after refactor.
- [ ] Skip `DocumentMapper` for event-driven path when the factory returns Vespa-ready dicts; keep `DocumentMapper` only for HTTP/legacy ingestion.
- [ ] Update `ingest_document_service()` to detect Vespa-ready payloads and bypass mapping accordingly.
