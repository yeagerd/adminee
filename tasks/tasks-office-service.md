## Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

### Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** 
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‑task**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  

### Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‑line description of its purpose.

### AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‑task** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‑task is next.
6. After implementing a sub‑task, update this file.

General instructions for working in Python in this repo:

Setup:
* Set up the unified development environment: `./setup-dev.sh`
* The virtual environment will be automatically activated
* Run all Python commands from the repository root.

Before committing:
* Run `pytest` and fix all test failures.
* Run `mypy services/` and resolve all type errors.
* Fix lint issues using `./fix`
* Run ``tox -p auto`` to validate the full test matrix and environment compatibility.

[x] 8.9 [Run `tox -p auto` and fix any errors.]

[x] 9. Implement Unified WRITE Endpoints (MVP)
[x] 9.1 [Implement POST /email/send in the email router. For the MVP, this can be a simple pass-through that determines the provider and makes the API call. The actual queuing can be stubbed or logged for now.]
[x] 9.2 [Implement POST /calendar/events. This endpoint will need to take unified CalendarEvent data, "de-normalize" it into the provider-specific format, and use the correct API client to create the event.]
[x] 9.3 [Implement DELETE /calendar/events/{event_id}. This will require logic to find the original provider and use its API to delete the event.]
[x] 9.4 [Write unit tests for unified write endpoints with mocked API clients.]
[x] 9.5 [Run ./fix to fix lint issues.]
[x] 9.6 [Run `tox -p auto` and fix any errors.]

[x] 10.1 [Configure structured logging for the application (e.g., using the standard logging library with a JSON formatter).]
[x] 10.2 [Create a global exception handler in app/main.py using the @app.exception_handler decorator.]
[x] 10.3 [The handler should catch a custom ProviderAPIError, log the full error, and return a standardized 500-level ApiError response to the client.]
[x] 10.4 [Modify the API clients to catch httpx exceptions and raise the custom ProviderAPIError to be handled by the global handler.]
[x] 10.5 [Write unit tests for error handling and logging functionality.]
[x] 10.6 [Run ./fix to fix lint issues.]
[x] 10.7 [Run `tox -p auto` and fix any errors.]

[x] 11. Testing and Documentation
[x] 11.1 [Create a tests/ directory with pytest.]
[x] 11.2 [Write integration tests for all API endpoints.]
[x] 11.4 [Add docstrings to all public functions and classes you've created.]
[x] 11.5 [Update the README.md file with instructions on how to set up the development environment, run the service, and run tests.]
[x] 11.6 [Run ./fix to fix lint issues.]
[x] 11.7 [Run `tox -p auto` and fix any errors.]
