# OpenAPI Schema Generation & TypeScript Type Sync

## Overview
Generate OpenAPI schemas from all Pydantic models across services and create TypeScript types for the frontend to eliminate duplicate type definitions and maintain a single source of truth.

**Note:** The build pipeline is now fully integrated with type generation. While there are still some type compatibility issues between the generated types and existing components (137 errors in 32 files), the infrastructure is complete and working. The remaining errors are due to using `CalendarEvent` as a placeholder for email-related types that don't exist in the generated schemas.
