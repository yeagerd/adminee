ðŸ¤– Creating Multi-Agent WorkflowAgent...
âœ… Multi-Agent system ready with 5 specialized agents:
   â€¢ Coordinator
   â€¢ CalendarAgent
   â€¢ EmailAgent
   â€¢ DocumentAgent
   â€¢ DraftAgent

ðŸ’¬ Chat started! (Current mode: Multi-Agent)
Type 'help' for commands or start chatting!

You: What meetings do I have today?
ðŸ¤– Briefly: Let me check your calendar for today's meetings...

[CalendarAgent searches calendar events]
[Coordinator synthesizes response]

I found 3 meetings scheduled for today:
1. Team Standup at 9:00 AM
2. Project Review at 2:00 PM  
3. One-on-one with Sarah at 4:30 PM

You: switch

ðŸ”„ Switching from Multi-Agent to Single-Agent mode...

ðŸ¤– Creating Single-Agent WorkflowAgent...
âœ… Single-Agent system ready

ðŸ’¬ Switched to Single-Agent mode. Continue chatting!

You: quit

ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for using the WorkflowAgent demo! Goodbye!
```

## Configuration

### LLM Settings

Edit the `create_agent` method in `chat-simple.py` to customize:

```python
agent = WorkflowAgent(
    thread_id=self.thread_id,
    user_id=self.user_id,
    llm_model="gpt-4",  # Change model here
    llm_provider="openai",  # Change provider here
    max_tokens=2000,
    use_multi_agent=use_multi_agent,
    office_service_url="http://localhost:8001",
)
```

### Office Service

Make sure the office service is running on `http://localhost:8001` or update the URL in the demo.

## Error Handling

The demo includes comprehensive error handling:
- LLM errors are caught and displayed gracefully
- Keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) exit cleanly
- Invalid commands show helpful messages
- Connection issues are reported clearly

## Advanced Usage

### Streaming Mode

Use `--streaming` flag to see real-time response generation:

```bash
python services/demos/chat-simple.py --streaming
```

This shows how the agent generates responses token by token, which is useful for understanding the workflow progression in multi-agent mode.

### Testing Different Scenarios

1. **Start in Multi-Agent mode** - Test complex workflows
2. **Switch to Single-Agent mode** - Compare performance
3. **Use 'clear'** - Test conversation memory reset
4. **Try example prompts** - Explore different agent capabilities

## Development

The demo is designed to be easily extensible:
- Add new commands by extending the command handling logic
- Customize the welcome message and examples
- Add new agent configurations or testing scenarios
- Integrate with different LLM providers
