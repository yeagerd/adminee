## How It Works

1. **User Input**: You provide a request or question
2. **Coordinator Analysis**: The CoordinatorAgent analyzes your request and determines which specialized agents to involve
3. **Agent Delegation**: Tasks are delegated to appropriate specialized agents
4. **Information Gathering**: Specialized agents use their tools to gather relevant information
5. **Context Sharing**: Agents record their findings for other agents to access
6. **Coordination**: The CoordinatorAgent synthesizes results from all agents
7. **Agent Handoffs**: Agents can hand off control to others as needed for complex workflows
8. **Final Response**: A comprehensive response is provided to the user

## Demo Flow

1. **Welcome Screen**: Shows introduction, available agents, and example prompts
2. **Agent Initialization**: Creates and builds the multi-agent WorkflowAgent system
3. **Interactive Chat**: Chat loop with command processing and agent coordination
4. **Graceful Exit**: Clean shutdown on quit/exit

## Configuration

### LLM Settings

Edit the `create_agent` method in `chat-simple.py` to customize:

```python
agent = WorkflowAgent(
    thread_id=self.thread_id,
    user_id=self.user_id,
    llm_model="gpt-4",  # Change model here
    llm_provider="openai",  # Change provider here
    max_tokens=2000,
    office_service_url="http://localhost:8001",
)
```

### Office Service

Make sure the office service is running on `http://localhost:8001` or update the URL in the demo.

## Error Handling

The demo includes comprehensive error handling:
- LLM errors are caught and displayed gracefully
- Keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) exit cleanly
- Invalid commands show helpful messages
- Agent coordination failures are handled gracefully
- Connection issues are reported clearly

## Advanced Usage

### Streaming Mode

Use `--streaming` flag to see real-time response generation:

```bash
python services/demos/chat-simple.py --streaming
```

This shows how the multi-agent system generates responses in real-time, including:
- Agent handoffs and coordination
- Tool usage by specialized agents
- Context sharing between agents
- Final response synthesis

### Testing Different Scenarios

1. **Simple single-agent queries** - Test individual agent capabilities
2. **Complex multi-agent workflows** - Test agent coordination
3. **Use 'clear'** - Test conversation memory reset across agents
4. **Try various example prompts** - Explore different agent specializations
